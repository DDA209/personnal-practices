    ## Naming
        All naming practices in my new projects

    ### Folders naming
    Folder names are written according to the following guidelines:
    - **Only with alphabetical and non accentuated letter**
    - **Never start with a number**, number can start from the second letter
    - Start with a lowercase letter, except:
        - **Components folders** who start with a uppercase 
    - Use **snake case** üêç if named with many words
    - Special characters are replaced with *underscores* _
    - Naming should be descriptive and consistent in the context of the use of th folder

``example:
my_folder
it_s_a_folder



``

### Glossary
- Folder: logical file container (not egal to directory) *e.g ./that_s_a_folder/*
