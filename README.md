  ## Naming
  All naming practices in my new projects

  ### Folders naming
  Folders names are written according to the following guidelines:
  - Only with alphabetical and non accentuated letter
  - Never start with a number, number can start from the second letter
  - Start with a lowercase letter
  - Use snake case üêç if named with many words
  - Special characters are replaced with *underscores* _
  - Initials and acronyms should be written in lowercase
  - Naming should be descriptive and consistent in the context of the use of the folder
  - Extensions are strongly discouraged and should be used for specific and documented purposes
  - use plural if folder contain many elements described by it's name

        folders tree example:
        ./omq
        ./omq/components
        ./omq/components/core
        ./omq/components/core/buttons
        ./omq/components/core/buttons/small_button
        ./omq/components/core/buttons/big_button

  ### Files naming
  Files names are written according to the following guidelines:
  - Only with alphabetical and non accentuated letter
  - Never start with a number, number can start from the second letter
  - Start with a lowercase letter, except:
    - Components folders** who start with an uppercase 
  - Use snake case üêç if named with many words
  - Special characters are replaced with *underscores* _
  - Initials and acronyms should be written in lowercase
  - Naming should be descriptive and consistent in the context of the use of the file
  - Naming must contain only one dot, it preced the file extension
